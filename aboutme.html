                            <p>
                                Hi, I’m <strong>Merve Tomečková Öztoprak</strong>, a bioanalytical scientist passionate about uncovering life’s hidden chemical stories. 
                                I am currently completing my PhD at <strong>NIOZ / Utrecht University</strong>, where I develop new mass spectrometry workflows 
                                (LC–Orbitrap MS) to study isotopic fingerprints of lipids. My work bridges analytical chemistry, data science, and environmental forensics, 
                                pushing the boundaries of how chemistry can reveal the origins, processes, and impacts of life on Earth’s systems.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With a cross-disciplinary background in ecosystem sciences, forestry, geobiology, and evolutionary biology, I discovered early on the power 
                                of analytical chemistry to expose life’s invisible traces. While studying at the <strong>Universities of Göttingen, Uppsala, and Munich</strong>, 
                                I became fascinated by how isotope and molecular tools uncover some of the oldest biosignatures on Earth — a perspective that continues to shape 
                                my research today. This curiosity has led me to research experiences at <strong>Caltech</strong>, the <strong>Australian National University</strong>, 
                                and <strong>BayerCropScience</strong>, as well as collaborations with partners in Svalbard, Hong Kong, and Italy. Along the way, I gained expertise 
                                in a wide range of techniques — from LC-MS and GC-MS to IRMS, applied omics, statistical modeling in R/Python, microbiology, and ecology — and 
                                learned the value of working across cultures, disciplines, and perspectives. I thrive in collaborative, international settings and am driven by 
                                turning innovative analytical ideas into tools that make a difference in environmental science, health, and forensic applications.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Outside of the lab, I enjoy hiking, painting, and traveling to spend time with family and friends across the globe. 
                                As a new mother, I find joy in fostering my daughter’s curiosity and experiencing the world through her eyes — a perspective 
                                that continually reminds me of the wonder and creativity that also drive my work as a scientist.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I believe as academics, we have a responsibility not only to advance knowledge, but also to apply our critical thinking skills and interdisciplinary 
                                experience to improve our communities. I have taken on leadership roles to this end by founding diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, 
                                mentoring colleagues and students through workshops, lectures and supervision, and serving the wider community by co-organizing conferences 
                                and collaborative networks.  
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                I am convinced we can overcome today’s greatest challenges — from the climate crisis to rising political tensions and humanitarian needs — 
                                if we resist nihilism and empower the next generation of academics, leaders, and citizens. This requires a commitment to rigorous 
                                scientific methods and fact-based approaches, ensuring that solutions and innovations remain grounded in evidence and guided by shared 
                                responsibility, respect, and justice.
