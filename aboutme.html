                    <p>
                        Hi, I’m <strong>Merve Tomečková Öztoprak</strong> — a bioanalytical scientist with a passion for exploring life’s hidden
                        chemical stories. I’m currently completing my PhD at <strong>NIOZ / Utrecht University</strong>, where I develop new
                        mass spectrometry workflows (LC–Orbitrap MS) to study isotopic fingerprints of lipids. My work bridges analytical
                        chemistry, data science, and environmental forensics, and I love pushing the boundaries of how we can use chemistry
                        to answer questions about origins, processes, and impacts of organisms on our earth systems and each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Coming from a cross-disciplinary background that spans ecosystem sciences, forestry, geobiology, and evolutionary biology,
                        I developed a fascination for using analytical chemistry to explore life’s hidden traces. During my studies at the <strong>Universities of Göttingen,
                        Uppsala, and Munich <strong>, I became captivated by how isotope and molecular tools can reveal some of the oldest biosignatures
                        on Earth — a perspective that continues to inspire my work in tracing invisible biosignatures today. This curiosity has
                        guided me through research experiences at <strong>Caltech</strong>, the <strong>Australian National University</strong>, 
                        and <strong>BayerCropScience</strong>, in addition to internships and research project with partners in Svalbard, Hong Kong, and Italy. 
                        Along the way I became fluent in a wide range of techniques — from LC-MS and GC-MS to IRMS, applied omics, 
                        statistical modeling in R/Python, microbiology to ecology — and learned how to work across cultures, fields, and disciplines. 
                        I thrive in collaborative, international settings, and I’m motivated by turning innovative analytical ideas into tools that matter,
                        whether in environmental science, health, or forensic applications.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Outside of the lab, I enjoy spending time hiking, painting, and traveling to spend time with family and friends across the globe.
                        As a recent mom, spending time fostering my daughter’s curiosity and seeing the world through her eyes reminds me of the wonder and 
                        creativity that also drive my work as a scientist. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I strongly believe that as academics we have a responsibility not only to advance knowledge through our research,
                        but also to use our training in critical thinking and our experience working across disciplines with diverse
                        stakeholders to improve the communities around us. To this end, I have contributed to the institutions where I
                        have worked by founding diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives, instructing colleagues and students through
                        workshops, lectures, and supervision, and serving the wider scientific community by co-organizing conferences and
                        community initiatives.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am convinced that we can overcome today’s greatest challenges — from the climate crisis to rising political
                        tensions and growing humanitarian needs — if we resist nihilism and continue to empower the next generation of
                        academics, leaders, and citizens to rigorously apply scientific methods and fact-based approaches, ensuring that solutions 
                        and innovations are grounded in evidence and guided by a spirit of shared responsibility for respectful and just treatment 
                        of others.
                    </p>
